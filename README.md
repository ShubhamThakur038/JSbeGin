# ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course

Here we have a simple Solidity program . The main  purpose of our program is to learn basics of solidity like creating contracts , mapping in solidity , creating functions , etc.


## Description
In this program the contract MyToken is a implementation of tokens in  the Ethereum blockchain.This smart contract allows its users to mint and burn the tokens . It also keeps a track of the total tokens available and the balance of each address  .It's written in Solidity version 0.8.26. This smart contract allows you to mint and burn tokens, keeping track of the total supply and the balances of each address.

Click on the link : https://remix.ethereum.org/ . 
Then first create a new file by clicking on "+" sign on the left side of the screen on the  sidebar and name the file and save it with '.sol' extension . 
Then write your solidity program there.

For compiliing the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand side sidebar. Make sure that the "Compiler" option is set on "0.8.26" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.
Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" option on the left-hand side sidebar. click on "Deploy" button.
